 Overview  of the Project
- Objective: Program an Arduino board to blink an LED at a specific interval.
- Components:
    - Arduino Uno board
    - LED light
    - Breadboard
    - Jumper wires
    - Power supply
- Software:
    - Arduino IDE (version 1.8.x or later)
- Concepts:
    - Digital output
    - Timing and delay
    - Embedded programming
    - Hardware interfacing
- Procedure:
    1. Connect the LED to digital pin 13 of the Arduino board.
    2. Write a program to turn the LED ON and OFF at a specific interval (e.g., 1 second).
    3. Use the delay() function to create the timing interval.
    4. Upload the program to the Arduino board.
    5. Observe the LED blinking at the specified interval.
- Expected Output:
    - The LED blinks ON and OFF at a 1-second interval.
- Variations:
    - Change the blinking interval by modifying the delay() value.
    - Add more LEDs and create a pattern or sequence.
    - Use a button or sensor to control the LED blinking.

This project introduces basic embedded programming concepts, such as digital output, timing, and hardware interfacing, using the Arduino platform.
